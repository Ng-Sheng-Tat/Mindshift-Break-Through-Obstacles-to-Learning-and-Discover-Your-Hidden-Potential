### Week 3

- avoiding *Passion Trap*, which is to acquire knowledge that only you have passion to extent that you might not needed, which makes you unemployed eventually

- balancing between the internal desires and the external working environment needs

- think you your carrer as a *T*, which you needs only one single profound knowledge of skills at one disciplines and only superficial knowledge on the other disciplines are **obsolete**

- at the moment you need the $\pi$ approaches, where you have two depth knowledge from both fields

- There are many examples of people becoming successful at their passion only because they stopped focusing directly and solely on that passion, and instead began incorporating real world considerations.

- the second field can be related or complement to your first knowledge, or they could just be your passions

- it is never a good idea to blindly follow your passion, but you should focus on one thing in order to get deep skilling in that area, but you don't have to give up on your passion. 

- In fact, your passion can greatly enhance your creative ability in your other skill. 

- It's never a good idea to just blindly follow your passion. In fact, look at the real world and work to both follow and broaden your passions. Your life will be greatly enriched

- the time to learn second scales is based on *logarithm scale* instead of linear scale, second skills put you in advantage over the others as the main discipline do not differentiate you from others, what is your achievement in your first discipline can be easily achieved and surpassed by others if they are taking those same discipline as their main disciplines, however, not many of them can expert as well to average extent for their second skills

- sometimes extra skills even non-related to technical areas can help you and complement your competency in your main discipline and win you the Nobel Prize by integrations

- **Avoiding being in debt** when choosing or doing a career shift

- goal should be reachable and doable, and have interim goals and check points to assess your progress

With the **dabble** approach, you simply start gradually learning in the new area, either online, through reading or by taking local classes. This is a slow approach. But it can also help ensure that you, yourself, can gradually grow with the change, which will make the transition less jarring for all involved. 

The **double life** approach is much more intense than dabbling. With this approach, you basically compartmentalize your life and avoid talking to people about what you're trying to do. This can be a more stressful way to tackle your change, but it can have an advantage. It can prevent others from trying to talk you out of your goals because you'll appear to be continuing just as usual. For example, you may continue working as a musician while you're taking side courses to prepare you for a career in health care. 

And then there's being a **contrarian**. Take pride in being a contrarian. The more others say you will fail, the more it can help bolster your internal resolve.

- do not adamtly working on a specific topic / discipline

- who you are depend on your environment as well

- In your attempts at career change, you don't want to minimize important considerations. Like whether you've got at least the basics of what it might take to succeed. Be willing to solicit and listen to valid criticism about how you can change and improve.

- You should develop *General Competence*, where you immerse yourself in doing what you are learning to depth level

- Youshould also practice *Selective Ignorance*, where you need to give up some chanes on learning something new even if you have the opportunity to learn it well because you are not going to have many time for all the things

- **Imposter syndrome** is that feeling that you're not as good or as talented as the other people around you. This is not very good but...

- you should doubt yourself consistently because it keeps your mind open to new ideas and necessary changes, remember it is overconfidence that makes people fail but not underconfidence

- Writting, speaking, soft skills, analytical, technological, social skills are all implement and complement to each other

- **Sheeple mentality**: Where you and your friends don't find out until it's too late that you've put yourself into decades of debt studying a favorite subject that's better off as a hobby than as a career

- A valuable point to keep in mind here is what I'll call, the golden rule of career catastrophes. And that is, it is never as bad as you think it is at the time and there is always a silver lining. Almost always as a result of being either fired or laid off, you ultimately find yourself happier in the long run

- Keep in mind that it's not usually a good idea to become too settled for too many years doing the same job. You can slip into a career rut that can be difficult to get out of. Even if you're doing a variety of activities for your work, your mind can still be following into the route or rut. Which means it can gently be moving towards stagnation. *Always keep learning new things, including when you are old*, and not just to the surface, you are going to be really serious on it. 

- Every *Bad Traits* has good side of it that can be leveraged and become your strength or *Good Traits*

- Emotions are important for social interactions, learning, and decision making. Emotions are complex brain states, associated with positive and negative experiences, and they are accompanied by facial expressions

- The three neuromodulatory systems based on serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine interact strongly with the emotional systems in the brain. Without them, we would not be human. With them, we are able to form social bonds, evaluate dangerous situations, and learn new skills.
