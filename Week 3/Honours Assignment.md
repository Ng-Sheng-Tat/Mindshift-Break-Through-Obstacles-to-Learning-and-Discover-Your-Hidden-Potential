The main idea of this course is relevant to mindshift, whereby we should change what we believe and shift lifestyles to align it with our goals. In week 1, we gone through the concept of slow learner, whereby being a slow learner enable one to spend more time on the subject and subsequently understand the subject matter in a deeper sense. This is very much related to my studies where i somehow frustrated when comparing with peers who can do tasks in a faster manner. I feels lacking behind but at the end the results turn out always be comparable to each others. When doing the revision, we should practice active learning, which is to get the hands on and practice instead of just reading the notes. I found this especially true when it comes to mathematics subjects. When doing revision, we should use a combination of focussed mode and diffused more. After a period of concentrating on the syllabus, it is best followed by mediation or mind rest activities to allow the neural connections to connect together and form a strong brain neural links which can be easily accessible. Practicing the Pomodoro techniques during the studies can effectively help us to eradicate procrastination. The techniques is characterized by having 25 minutes of intense focus, which is followed by 5 to 10 minutes mental breaks. It helps us to avoid ourselves from distractions. On the other hand, it is advisable to trying to socialize as it could affect our brain and refresh our mind when we interacts with people. It is important to practice selective ignorance to delegate the necessary tasks to other, because at the end with the limited time and energy, we cannot do and complete everything by ourselves to satisfactory level. 

**Key Topics from Week 1**

- Slow learners. By using persistence and flexibility, slow learners can see things that geniuses miss.
- Active learning. Try to actively do whatever you are trying to learn.
- Mastery learning. Whether you learn it quickly or slowly, you can still learn it!
- The value of your past. Seemingly unconnected knowledge from your past can bring unexpected assets to your work in the present. Remember—it's typical to feel incompetent when you first try to change.
- Focused and diffuse modes of thinking bring very different insights into your learning.
- Match passions with opportunities. It’s important to take a strategic as well as a passion influenced approach to your learning. Work to broaden, not just follow, your passions.
- The role of the environment around you. Who you hang out with, and the environment you live and work in, can make a difference in your behavior. Occasional small disruptions, as with the clinking in a coffee shop, can sometimes enhance bigger picture learning. Also, complex systems shouldn't just be memorized.

**Key Topics from Week 2**

- A poor memory is valuable. It can help you be more creative and to see shortcuts that other people can’t figure out.
- Meditation can have different effects. Focused attention types of meditation help enhance focused mode type thinking, while open monitoring types can enhance diffuse, imaginative thinking. It’s important to have time each day where your mind can wander.
- The Pomodoro technique can be a form of working meditation where you practice your focus on work or studies.
- Procrastination can arise from many factors. To tackle procrastination, it helps to increase expectancy of success, to increase the value of what you’re working on, or to decrease impulsiveness (remove distractions!).
- Procedural fluency and deliberate practice can help the hard stuff become easy.
- Mental tricks can be invaluable in helping you reframe and reduce anxiety and worry. Putting a label on your feelings is especially valuable in allowing you to reduce painful emotions.

**Key Topics from Week 4**

- Exercise, learning, exposure to new envi­ronments, and even video games can help create and nurture new neurons and synapses that help create a “cognitive reserve” that keeps you healthy as you age.  If you don’t use it, you can lose it—no matter how innate and natural your gifts might seem.
