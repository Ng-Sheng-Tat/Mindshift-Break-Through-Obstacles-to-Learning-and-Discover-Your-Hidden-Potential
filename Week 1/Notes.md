### Week 1

**Mindshift** is a *deep change* in life that occurs due to *learning*

- **race-car learner** against **hiker-bike** learner who can see the subjects detials more deeply inside
- *persistence* and *flexibility* to verify your hypothesis throughout your study is the key instead of being a *genuises*
- *active learning* is important whereby you do whatever things hands-on without referring to any other materials. *teaching* is the key aspects from active learning, which if done correctly can keep you from social distractions

- traditionally, people study and assumes by *normal science*, which is then coupled with a *paradigm shift* which contributes to the advancement of the world

**Two-Mind Shift Characteristics**
1. See the world though a *young child* perspective like Einstein
2. after you switch your profession, your old experience will make your eyes fresh in seeing the things in the new professions

**Mastery Learning** recognizes that different people need different time to learn new skills, and that is why MOOC is a very good platform for learning new skills to the professional levels as the recordings can be revisited for many time for mastery purposes

**Diffuse Mode** and **Focussed Mode** thinking where you should use a combination of both mode in your study, focussed mode makes every information on your head, while diffuse mode wire the information up together so that your knowledge is consolidated. Diffuse mode is when you are not concentrating deliberately on any subjects.

- learning with musics only when you are confortable with it, and generally uses music that is without *lyrics* is better for your studies

- learning couples with diffused and foccused mode, so concentrating enough in a quite plate in a focussed mode then hanging out with people in the coffee shops which is having some noise allows your diffuse mode to be wider and then find the connections and allows for mastery of the subjects

- cramping last minutes everything in minds do no help you understand the subjects matters, but it only helps you to temporary remember the key words. 

- your environment will affect who you are, it affects your emotional states, memories, and brains, like how you think differently when you are in the temple or inside an entertainment or sport environment, natural places with natural light and broad space tends to provide good place for your mind to diffuse and enhance your study experience, and your ability to absorb and memorize the materials

- you should always broaden your *passion* and match your passion with your opportunity, goals and career, for instance trying out non-technical things instead of technical things that you are used to be, and vice versa

- girls and boys have the basics capability in doing maths and sciences, but girls tend to have more advance verbal development, people usually doing what they are good at, they claim they have passion doing that thing, but in reality, it is encourage to try different things that are not easy for you and you take initiatives to learn it through (broaden your passions)

- you should practice **active recall or active retrieval** instead of trying to read the notes over and over again

- uses metaphor and symbolic to enhance your memory when memorizing
