- people with poor working memory tends to be more creative as you grabs your chunk, it falls, new chunks come in, and people with this issues tends to figure out *mental tricks* that helps then to remember things easily, and that is why they turns out remember things more easily and elegantly

**Mediation** is about using diffrent modes of conciousness using a variety of differnet techniques. Two types of mediation includes:

**Putting a label on your feelings** is one of the most helpful mental tricks you can use when you find yourself being emotionally upset. Applying a label forces you to put your emotional feelings into words. And moving feelings into words helps you shift your thinking from the emotional centers of your brain to the more rational parts of your brain, which automatically begins to tone down your emotions. Fortunately, a field called **cognitive therapy** has developed a checklist of common emotionally-based distortions of thinking. This checklist provides an automatic set of labels. Not only does this labeling start helping to calm you down, it also helps you to more easily see the distortions In your thinking. 

First, I was using **all or nothing thinking**. I felt if I didn't get good grades, I was a total failure. I mean, really. The reality was that I wasn't a total failure by any stretch of the imagination. Even if I'd flunked out of the university, I wouldn't have been a total failure. I was exploding the significance of that semester of poor grades. The reality was that even if I'd flunked out of school, and hadn't been successful at changing my brain to be able to effectively study math, I likely would've found a way to go on and have a successful and happy life.

And then there's **overgeneralization**. I saw one semester's failure as part of a series of failures in my life. Sure, I'd done badly that semester, but I've done badly before. As when I'd been a failure as a signal officer in the military. But previously, I'd also done well at some things, like studying Russian. When I thought I was a failure, I simply wasn't looking at the bigger picture. I was overgeneralizing in thinking I'd always have bad grades. Remember Nobel Prize winning psychologist, Daniel Kahneman's point? Nothing in life is as important as you think it is while you're thinking about it. At that time, I felt like my life was a complete failure. I was obviously wrong. 

I was also using a **mental filter**. I was focusing on my one semester's poor grades and obsessing on them and forgetting about everything else. Here were all these good and beautiful things around me everywhere, and I was ignoring them. I was also discounting the positive. I'd worked hard and previously been able to get good grades. I had a wonderful husband who I'd met at the South Pole station in Antarctica. I had my good health. 

I was also **jumping to conclusions**. Somehow, in my mind, I was predicting that things would go badly from then on. The reality was that I didn't really know what was going to happen from then on out. I was also **mind reading**. Thinking that others were going to think badly of me. I really had no idea what other people, like my family, would think. I was falling victim to my own emotional reasoning. I assumed that just because I felt negatively about what had happened, that it really was a negative thing. Actually, my feelings had little to do with what was happening in the real world. The whole incident was equivalent to me feeling terrified of the airplane flight, and the flight was actually perfectly fine. I was telling myself I should have done better. Shouldy kind of thinking, these kinds of statements just aren't helpful. They lead only to guilt, anger, and frustration. I was also using pejoratives of myself. I was telling myself I was stupid, I was an idiot, and that what happened was absolutely terrible. This kind of name calling does no good at all. In fact, it makes you feel bad about yourself and also leaves you feeling angry and frustrated. What happened was unfortunate, but it wasn't terrible. In fact, getting a few bad grades really wasn't a big deal at all in the greater scheme of how my life unfolded. 

Sometimes we take blame and assume responsibility for errors we didn't make. Or we inappropriately blame others. In my case, I blamed myself for my bad grades. After all, I was to blame for getting away from my studies for a year. But did I really need to drag myself under the bus for having undertaken some great adventures? So we've gone over a list of labels you can use to move yourself from an emotionally based framework to a more rational, calmed down part of the brain where you can more carefully analyze and reason away the distortions in your thinking. 

There's one more trick you can use to help positively reframe. And that is to find positive ways to think about a negative experience. For example, if you failed at business, think of it as a great learning experience that many ultimately successful entrepreneurs have also had. If you didn't get the job you wanted, well, that's leaving you open for a better job ahead. And meanwhile, it's a great signal for you to upgrade your skills. Did poorly on an exam? Well, maybe that's a clue to examine your study habits. Your best friend dying of cancer? Well, maybe you want to focus on trying to improve the quality of the life your friend has remaining.

**Learning Styles can be classified into visual, auditory, read/write or kinesthetic**, which is adviced to be used all for anyone to maximize the learning experience. 

**You can try to learn as much things as possible**, but learn it with true heart, you never complete the courses if you just want to get the certificate in real fast way.

- you perspectives on the surroundings are important towards your thinking and behaviour
